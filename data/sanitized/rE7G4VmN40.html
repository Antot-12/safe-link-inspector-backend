A small web app that lets you paste any link and check it safely.
It unshortens redirects, looks at basic risk signals, shows TLS/WHOIS/security headers, parses forms, and lets you preview the page in a sandboxed viewer.

Frontend: React (Vite)
Backend: Node.js + Express


Screenshots


Analyzer (main)

![Analyzer](docs/screenshot-analyzer.png)



Live sandbox viewer

![Live](docs/screenshot-live.png)




Features


Paste a URL and analyze:

Unshorten redirect chain
Risk score + label
Reputation stubs (GSB, PhishTank, urlscan – off by default until you add keys)
TLS profile (issuer, expiry, SAN vs host)
WHOIS age (domain age in days)
Security headers + Set-Cookie flags (Secure/HttpOnly/SameSite)
Basic network info (IP/ASN/geo) via resolver
Form analysis (actions, cross-domain posts, sensitive fields)
HSTS + HTTP → HTTPS redirect indicator



Sanitized HTML: stored server-side with strict CSP, previewed in an iframe


Live (sandboxed): separate origin proxy (/live?url=...) with CSP, frame-bust fixes, and asset rewriting


History:

Search, filter by risk, sort (newest / by risk)
Re-analyze, open, view sanitized, share public page
Export CSV/JSON, import JSON
Clear all



Keyboard shortcuts:

/ focuses the URL input
Ctrl+Enter runs Analyze
In History: “Show in analyzer” scrolls to top

Requirements

Node.js 20+ (works on Node 22 too)


Quick start (local dev)
Open two terminals.
Terminal 1 - backend
cd server
npm install
npm run dev

Default API URL: http://localhost:4000
Health: GET /api/health

Terminal 2 - live sandbox server
The live server is started automatically by the API (startLiveServer() in index.mjs).
Default live URL: http://localhost:4080
Terminal 3 – frontend (React/Vite)
cd app
npm install
# make sure app/.env points to live origin 
npm run dev
Vite will open: http://localhost:5173

Environment variables
app/.env
VITE_LIVE_ORIGIN=http://localhost:4080

server/.env (optional)
PORT=4000
LIVE_PORT=4080
CACHE_TTL_MIN=15

If ports are busy, change them here and update VITE_LIVE_ORIGIN in the frontend.

How to download from Git
Clone
git clone https://github.com/Antot-12/SafeLinkInspector.git
cd SafeLinkInspector

Development notes
API endpoints (main)


POST /api/analyze
Body: { "url": "https://..." }
Returns: analysis object with finalUrl, risk, headers, tls, whois, forms, sanitized path, etc.


GET /api/history
Query: q, risk (low|medium|high|all), sort (newest|risk), skip, limit
Returns: { items, total }


GET /api/history/:id


DELETE /api/history/:id


DELETE /api/history (clear all)


GET /api/history/export?fmt=csv|json


POST /api/history/import (body: a JSON array of records)


GET /api/sanitized/:id (strict CSP view of the saved HTML)


Live sandbox


GET /live?url=...
Returns rewritten HTML:

removes site CSP/meta CSP and X-Frame headers
injects &lt;base href="..."&gt;
neutralizes typical frame-busting (top.location → window.location, etc.)
rewrites href/src/action to /asset?url=...



GET /asset?url=...
Fetches assets through the live server

rewrites CSS url(...) to go via /asset
strips Set-Cookie
sends realistic User-Agent headers



Why “Live (sandboxed)” can be blank

Some pages require login or cookies to render.
The live proxy strips cookies by design for safety, so private pages may stay blank.
If the page uses heavy client protection, it can still block rendering inside iframes.

Tip: test public pages first. If you really need to debug with cookies, add a temporary flag in liveServer.mjs to allow them (unsafe for general use).

Build for production
This is a simple local tool, but you can still build the frontend:
cd app
npm run build
# output in app/dist
Serve app/dist behind any static server or connect it to the API with a reverse proxy.

Troubleshooting


Live is white
Check VITE_LIVE_ORIGIN points to the correct live server port.
Try a different, public URL. Some sites need login or strict cookies.


Port in use
Change PORT and/or LIVE_PORT in server/.env.
Change the frontend VITE_LIVE_ORIGIN accordingly.


CORS
Frontend runs on 5173 (or 5174). The API’s CORS list includes those origins.



Security model

Analyzer fetches target HTML on the server and saves a sanitized copy with very strict CSP.
Live viewer runs on a different origin and rewrites the page to avoid dangerous behaviors in iframes.
Cookies from target sites are not passed through to client.
